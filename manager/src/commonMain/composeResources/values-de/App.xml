PLEASE CONSIDER THESE NOTES BEFORE STARTING YOUR TRANSLATION WORK!

1. General notes about translation strings.
   https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-resources-usage.html#strings

2. Be aware, that plural definitions are language specific.
   According to your language, you might need to set different quantity values.
   https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-resources-usage.html#plurals

3. Special handling of long translation texts:
   - Line separators (\n and \r) are ignored. Multiple lines are combined to a single line seperated by a single space.
   - Leading and trailing space is removed on each line.
   - Empty lines are ignored.
   - Use [br] to enforce a line break within a translation.

4. Always use natural case shift for your language. The application decides, if single words or word groups are written
   with a capital letter or not.

5. Please do not reorder / rearrange the XML elements in this file and keep empty line intact.

6. Make sure, that the XML files is saved in Unicode / UTF-8 charset.
