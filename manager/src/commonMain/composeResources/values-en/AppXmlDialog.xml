PLEASE CONSIDER THESE NOTES BEFORE STARTING YOUR TRANSLATION WORK!

1. General notes about translation strings.

2. Be aware, that plural definitions are language specific.
   According to your language, you might need to set different quantity values.

3. Special handling of long translation texts:
   - Line separators (\n and \r) are ignored. Multiple lines are combined to a single line seperated by a single space.
   - Leading and trailing space is removed on each line.
   - Empty lines are ignored.
   - Use [br] to enforce a line break within a translation.

4. Always use natural case shift for your language. The application decides, if single words or word groups are written
   with a capital letter or not.

5. Please do not reorder / rearrange the XML elements in this file and keep empty line intact.
